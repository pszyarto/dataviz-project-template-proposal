# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize is a Global AI Adoption & Impact table that I already integrated into my project.
Each row represents a Country × Year × Industry observation with the following fields:
•	Country, Year, Industry

•	AI Adoption Rate (%)

•	AI-Generated Content Volume (TBs per year)

•	Job Loss Due to AI (%)

•	Revenue Increase Due to AI (%)

•	Human–AI Collaboration Rate (%)

•	Top AI Tools Used (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney)

•	Regulation Status (Lenient / Moderate / Strict)

•	Consumer Trust in AI (%)

•	Market Share of AI Companies (%)
This dataset lets me compare adoption, output, economic effects, workforce effects, and policy/trust context across places, industries, and time.





## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
